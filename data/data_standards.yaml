# In this file, you'll find naming and unit conventions for common fields across the datasets in matbench

formula:
    description: Chemical formula
    example: "NaCl"
    units: None
    notes: must be in form compatible with matminer composition featurizers

atom:
    description: Name of the atom
    example: "Hg"
    units: None
    notes: None

element:
    description: Name of the atom
    example: "Hg"
