# In this file, you'll find naming and unit conventions for common fields across the datasets in matbench

formula:
    description: Chemical formula
    example: "NaCl"
    units: None
    notes: must be in form compatible with matminer composition featurizers

atom:
    description: Name of the atom
    example: "Hg"
    units: None
    notes: Can be prefixed or suffixed depending on the study (ie perovskites have atom1, atom2, etc.)

element:
    description: Name of the atom
    example: "Hg"
    units: None
    notes: Same as atom

specie:
    description: Name of the specie or ion
    example: "Na+1"
    units: None
    notes: Oxidation state should always be present in pymatgen format, e.g., Na0+

chemsys:
    description: Chemical system of the composition or structure
    example: "Na-Cl"
    units: None
    notes: None

chemsys_abc:
    description: Chemical system of the composition or structure
    example: "Cl-Na"
    units: None
    notes: Sorted alphabetically, for normalization

gap:
    description: The band gap of the material
    example: 2.1
    units: eV
    notes: 'gap' may be followed by the kind of gap data; e.g., 'gap expt', 'gap pbe', or 'gap gllbsc'

lumo:
    description: Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
    example: -1.532
    units: eV
    notes: None

mpid:
    description: Materials project material_id, shortened to mpid
    example: "mp-1234"
    units: None
    notes: *_load() function should return this as a column preferably, not index

ehull:
    description: Energy above the convex hull in the chemical system
    example: 0.002
    units: eV
    notes: None

eformation:
    description: Energy of formation, for crystal structures
    example: -2.744
    units: eV/atom
    notes: Add on words that specifiy the type, e.g., "eformation oxygen vacancy"

structure:
    description: The pymatgen structure object, as the object (not a dict!)
    example: <class 'pymatgen.core.structure.Structure'>
    units: None
    notes: Should be loaded as an object, not a dict (so we can featurize right away)

bulkmod:
    description: The bulk modulus
    example: 20.3
    units: GPa
    notes: It is ok to put the kind of bulk modulus after, e.g., bulkmod VRH

elasticmod:
    description: The elastic modulus
    example: 184.1
    units: GPa
    notes: None

shearmod:
    description: The shear modulus
    example: 20.3
    units: GPa
    notes: It is ok to put the kind of shear modulus after, e.g., shearmod VRH

mu_B:
    description: The magnetic moment of the material (mu_B)
    example: 0.01
    units: None
    notes: None
