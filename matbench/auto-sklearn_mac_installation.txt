https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/?source=typ_redirect

go to folder and then
./configure
make
make install

done!

try:
pip install auto-sklearn

if didn’t succeed it may be due to generic Mac c-compiler not supporting random, etc c++ packages

try:
(in your conda environment)
conda install gcc

to see if you have it installed, open python in your conda env and then:
import autosklearn
