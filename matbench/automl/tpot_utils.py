-AF: 
TPOT (https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot) is an academic open-sourced 
package that seems to be suitable overall to matbench though there doesn't 
seem to be an explicit support for feature importance.

It uses genetic algorithm to find the estimator with the set of parameters that 
returns the best score (supports many scoring metrics)

    pros:
        + easy install: "pip install tpot"; written in python
        + easily accessible history of models tried and their accuracy 
          (in evaluated_individuals_)
        + automatic global optimization already implemented
        + seems more organized than automl
        + writes sample pipeline to file to resume/modify analysis
    cons:
        - no feature importance as far as I can tell
        - I have had some difficulties using it in Pycharm as opposed to 
          Terminal and Jupyter notebooks

    """
    Returns a class wrapped on TPOTClassifier or TPOTRegressor (differentiated
    via mode argument) but with additional visualization and
    post-processing methods for easier analysis.

    Args:
        mode (str): determines TPOTClassifier or TPOTRegressor to be used
            For example "Classification" or "regressor" are valid options.

        feature_names ([str]): list of feature/column names that is optionally
            passed for post-training analyses.

        **kwargs: keyword arguments accepted by TpotWrapper which have a few
            more arguments in addition to TPOTClassifier or TPOTRegressor
            For example: scoring='r2'; see TpotWrapper and TPOT documentation
            for more details.

    Note that for example, you can limit the models that TPOT explores
    by setting config_dict directly. For example, if you want to only
    use random forest:
        config_dict = {
            'sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor': {
                'n_estimators': [100],
